Overview
--------
<a id="overview"></a>

__poppyGP-engine__ provides a data access layer for the __poppyGP-player__ front-end web application.  Its role resembles that of a REST API.

The project will serve to provide a number of features as outlined in the section appropriately titled [Features](#features).

Development of the project with the LAMP stack:

 * Linux (Ubuntu or Amazon Linux?)
 * PHP 5.6
 * MySQL 5.7
 * Apache 2.4

More information can be found in the [Technologies](#tech) section.




Technologies
------------
<a id="tech"></a>

Numerous technologies are utilised in this project, amongst which are PHP frameworks and libraries, development tools, and a variety of mish-mash (for lack of a better term).


__[Slim Framework 3](http://www.slimframework.com/)__ lightweight PHP micro-framework

The third version is currently in `RC1` stage.  Hopefully, __poppyGP-engine__ development will provide useful in contributions towards the development of Slim Framework.


__[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)__ - PHP dependency managemer


I intend on expanding upon this section as more technologies are implemented.

### poppyGP Schedule ###

Responds with `JSON` schedule data to `GET` requests from the webapp.


__Request Handling__

 * __Default Behaviour__ - return data includes array of `track` objects:
   * Current Track
   * Previous Tracks (default 1)
   * Next Tracks (default 3)
 * __Paging__ - modify number of past and/or future tracks (will still return other default behaviour objects)?
   * `api/schedule?prev=10` retrieves past 10 tracks, as well as current track and next three tracks
   * `api/schedule?next=10` retrieves next 10 tracks, as well as current track and past track
 * __Offset__ - offset the results; only available for upcoming tracks:
   * `api/schedule?next=10&offset=20` retrieves next 10 tracks, offset by 20
